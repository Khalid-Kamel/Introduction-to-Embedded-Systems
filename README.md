 and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of
 the data set. In addition,it reorders this data set
 from large to small. All statistics are rounded down to the 
 nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, it prints
 that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
